Objectives
Automated Garage Door Control:

Enable automated opening and closing of the garage door based on the state of a connected Bolt IoT module.
Safety Distance Measurement:

Utilize an ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance between a vehicle and the garage wall to prevent collisions.
Alert Mechanism:

Implement a buzzer that alerts when the vehicle is too close to the garage wall.
Remote Monitoring and Control:

Use the Bolt IoT module for remote monitoring and control of the garage door status via the internet.
Requirements
Hardware
Arduino Board:

A microcontroller board to control the components and execute the program logic.
Bolt IoT Module:

A Wi-Fi module for remote control and monitoring of the garage door.
Ultrasonic Sensor (e.g., HC-SR04):

To measure the distance between the vehicle and the garage wall.
LM293D Motor Driver:

To control the direction and speed of the motor used for opening and closing the garage door.
DC Motor:

To physically move the garage door.
Buzzer:

To provide audio alerts when the vehicle is too close to the wall.
Power Supply:

Adequate power supply for the Arduino, motor driver, motor, and other components.
Connecting Wires:

To connect the components to the Arduino.
Breadboard (optional):

For prototyping and testing the connections.
Software
Arduino IDE:

To write and upload the program to the Arduino board.
Bolt IoT Platform:

For remote monitoring and control capabilities.
Ultrasonic Library:

For interfacing with the ultrasonic sensor.
Functional Requirements
Garage Door Control Logic:

Implement logic to open and close the garage door based on the state read from the Bolt IoT module.
Distance Measurement and Alert:

Measure distance continuously when the garage door is open and trigger the buzzer if the distance is less than a defined threshold (e.g., 30 cm).
Serial Communication:

Print status messages to the serial monitor for debugging and monitoring purposes.
State Management:

Maintain and update the state of the garage door (open or closed).
Delay Management:

Implement delays appropriately to ensure smooth operation of the door and accurate sensor readings.
Non-Functional Requirements
Reliability:

Ensure the system operates reliably under different conditions.
Safety:

Implement safety measures to prevent accidents, such as stopping the motor if an obstacle is detected.
Scalability:

The system should be scalable for future enhancements, such as adding more sensors or integrating with other smart home systems.
Ease of Use:

The system should be user-friendly, with simple controls and clear status indications.
Maintenance:

The system should be easy to maintain and troubleshoot, with accessible components and clear documentation.
Development and Testing
Prototyping:

Start with a prototype to test individual components and their integration.
Integration Testing:

Test the integration of all components to ensure they work together as expected.
Validation:

Validate the system against the requirements and objectives to ensure it meets all criteria.
Deployment:

Deploy the system in the actual garage environment and monitor its performance.
Documentation:

Provide detailed documentation for setup, usage, and maintenance.
Future Enhancements
Mobile App Integration:

Develop a mobile app for easier remote control and monitoring.
Camera Integration:

Add a camera for visual monitoring of the garage.
Voice Control:

Integrate with voice assistants like Alexa or Google Assistant for voice control.
Additional Sensors:

Add more sensors for enhanced functionality, such as temperature or humidity sensors.
Advanced Alert System:

Implement advanced alert mechanisms, such as SMS or email notifications.# SMART-GARAGE
